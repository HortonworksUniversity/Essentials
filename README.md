# Hadoop Essentials

This GitHub project stores content related to the [Hadoop Essentials](http://hortonworks.com/training/class/hadoop-essentials/ "Hadoop Essentials")
course offering from Hortonworks Univeristy.

Status: Under Development

## Approach & Setup

The Hadoop Essentials course uses demonstrations instead of hands-on labs due to the
short duration of the offering.  That said, the demos are closely aligned with the
[publicly available tutorials](http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/#tutorial_gallery "Tutorials").

Additionally, to allow participants to recreate the demos performed during the course, the 
[Hortonworks Sandbox](http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/ "Hortonworks Sandbox") 
is utilized.  See [Sandbox Setup](./demos/SandboxSetup.md) for specific setup and configuration 
details regarding this course.

_The target audience for this repo is the instructors themselves to provide
them with guidance for presenting these demos to a live audience, but all
are welcome to utilize and feedback (and fixes via pull requests) is 
surely appreciated._
